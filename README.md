## K-pop-front-end
# Project Description
Fandom life made easier and more dynamic. Stay connected with your artists on K-pop Trivia Fever! Here you can play quizes, read blogs and create quizes or blog related to your favorite K-pop group or idol.
We have created a Reatc based web application. This is a interactive site for K-pop fans! If you love this music genre like we do, then you will get a kick out of this site. (This is the front end side. At the bottom of this readme in the Mock up section is the link for acquiring the back end side.)
